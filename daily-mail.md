Daily mail rebuttal
================

## Accusations

The Daily Mail has made repeated accusations that PHE has made
“blunders” in the reporting of case figures for the UK. In particular

-   The sum of daily reported cases is not equal to cumulative case
    count

-   Historical data is not corrected as a so-called expert thought it
    should be

-   There are lots of minor unexplained corrections

### Summary

The Daily Mail’s accusations are unfounded and a sugnificant
misintrepretation of the data, and PHE’s role in it. They are based on:

-   An oversimplistic analysis

-   A failure to analyse the data correctly

-   A failure to understand key principles of public reporting

-   A failure to seek appropriate expert advice or review

## Reporting cases

To date more the 2.5 million people have tested positive for SARS-Cov-2
through PCR testing.

Cases are reported on people testing positive, **not** positive tests.
Positive test results for England are held in a database known as SGSS.
There are equivalent databases for Northern Ireland (NI), Scotland and
Wales. These databases receive positive test results daily (usually
overnight) from testing labs across the country.

The SGSS database collects data on all positive results for a wide range
of communicable diseases, not only SARS-Cov-2. It has had to be
substantially upgraded to manage lab returns for SARS-Cov-2 as the
number of labs processing tests has grown. In the early part of the
pandemic lab capacity was limited to NHS and PHE labs - known as
*pillar1*. WIth the advent of mass-testing private and other labs were
recruited - this tranche of testing is known as *pillar2*.

To calculate **people** tested the data needs to be de-duplicated, that
is each person who has had a positive PCR test is counted only once no
matter how many how many tests - positive or negative - they have had.
This de-duplication exercise is conducted by Public Health England for
England data, and respective public health agencies across the UK.

Although both pillar data were de-duplicated, they were de-duplicated
separately because they had separate date streams - they weren’t
combined initially. In order to get an accurate count of the number of
**people** who had tested positive pillar1 and pillar2 data needed to be
combined and de-duplication conducted across the combined dataset. The
results of this exercise resulted in major changes to the data published
and was implemented in public reporting on 2nd July. Similar exercises
were conducted by other nations in the days and weeks that followed.

Prior to 2nd July 2020 the public dashboard:

-   Reported a UK case figure including un-deduplicated pillar1 and
    pillar2 data for the 4 nations. This included the duplicated results
    for England - the largest contributor to the UK figure - with
    potentially multiple positive tests per person.

-   Reported England case data for pillar1 only. Case data for other
    countries was pillar1 with some pillar data for Scotland and Wales.

-   Was unable to report case numbers for sub-national areas like
    regions and local authorities.

The de-duplication exercise had a number of consequences:

1.  More than 30000 duplicate cases were removed from the reported UK
    total on 2nd July.

2.  More than 80000 pillar2 cases were added to the reported England
    total on 2nd July

3.  We were able to add complete case counts per local authority to the
    dashboard.

### Why doesn’t the sum of daily reported cases add up the cumulative total reported cases?

There are 2 main reasons for this:

1.  We do **not correct the daily reported count. These figures are the
    reported historical record of the number of cases in the pandemic on
    the the day they are reported and are not retrospectively amended.
    Tens of thousands of people have kept paper or digital records of
    the daily reported figures since the beginning of the pandemic and
    would raise questions of trustworthiness if we retrospectively
    amended the data.**
2.  For this reason it there are corrections to be made, they are made
    to the cumulative total
3.  We **cannot** c**orrect the daily reported count.** If cases are
    removed or added to the database in batches we can know when the
    relevant tests were done but not when they would have been reported.
    We do not have the data to do this, and we only get aggregate data
    from the DAs. This was especially the case for the pillar2 data
    which reflected data over a four month period.
4.  This is unlike reporting by specimen data which is a better way to
    understand the pandemic (see below)
5.  For this reason, the UK cumulative figure is 30,000 less than the
    sum of daily reported cases since the 2nd July. A further correction
    was made on 27th November when 1,283 or so cases were removed from
    the UK total because of the correction made to reporting cases from
    the Milton Keynes Lighthouse lab.

Figure shows the differences between cumulative totals and the sum of
the daily published totals for each nation and the UK as whole.

-   Panel A (UK) shows the loss of 30,000 + cases from the UK cumulative
    count plus the recent reduction from the Milton Keynes lab

-   Panel B (England) shows the addition of 80,000 cases to the England
    cumulative count plus the reduction of cases from the Milton Keynes
    lab

-   Panel C (NI) shows the gradual addition of 1000 cases

-   Panel D (Scotland) shows the addition of 2000 cases to the Scottish
    cumulative total

-   Panel E (Wales) shows the addition of the 800 or so pillar2 cases
    which weren’t previously reported in the UK total but were added to
    the Welsh (and therefore the UK total) on 14th July. There have been
    multiple corrections to Welsh data since then.

### The role of PHE

Much approbation is levelled at PHE. PHE does have a significant role in
the reporting - it does collect English case data and produce death
data, and members of PHE design, build and populate the public
dashboard. on behalf of UK Government. Many others are involved however:

-   Approval and sign off for publishing is the DHSC and the SofS
    office.

-   Decisions on allocation or subtraction of cases is agreed with DHSC
    or SofS office

-   The DAs operate their own data collection and reporting rules and
    systems.

-   Metrics reported are determined by the govt., scientific advisers,
    CMOs office and PHE epidemiologists as well as SAGE, No 10 and DHSC
    and are influenced by WHO and international reporting.

### Reported vs specimen date

If we look at the 53,180 cases in England reported on 4th Janary 2020,
5.74% of these were from tests performed on 2021-01-03; 52.65% on
2021-01-02; 20.08% on 2021-01-01; 11.37% on 2020-12-31 and 8.44% on
2020-12-30. It takes at least 5 days for all the tests for any given day
to be reported. Conversely, reported figures (cases by publication date)
are the total of tests over many days and contrary to opinion do not
give the most timely picture of the pandemic but an estimate of it.

Specimen date analysis is far more robust and although it is lagged by 5
days (data for 4th January is complete for 30th December), gives a much
more robust picture of recent trends. The cumulative cases by specimen
date is exactly equal to the sum of new cases by specimen date.
