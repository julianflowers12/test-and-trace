# Introduction

The coronavirus dashboard (<https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk>) is the public facing site for daily publication of official UK figures on the COVID pandemic

It now serves in excess of 800,000 unique users a day, with a peak of 80,000 view a minute in the period. 5 Tb of data is downloaded daily. 50% of users

We process over 500m rows of data daily to generate 100m data points which populate the website front end with 200 metrics.

We provide access to:

-   Daily data on tests, cases, deaths, vaccinations, health care metrics

-   MSOA data

-   Small area mapping and local statistics

-   Extensive download and data reuse services via a downloads page and a set of APIs

95% of our users are members of the general public but the service is widely used in central government including PHE, T&T and JBC; local goverment; the NHS; national and local media; academics, and international reporting agencies.

We calculate

-   UK figures which are reported daily on mainstream media

-   Daily sitreps

-   MSOA data

-   5 metrics for tier decisions

-   Rates, rolling average, rolling sums for several metrics

It has evolved in 4 phases

## How it works

### Daily process

-   Data is ingested from a wide range of data sources daily including PHE, NSHE, Test and Trace, Scottish, Welsh and Irish govt and public health agencies into the NHS Foundry System

-   Data is a mix of large record datasets, spreadsheets and API calls

-   Each data set undergoes a set of transformations (cleaning, aggregating) and calculations to extract the aggregate data from inputs or create metrics from the raw data. About x transformations are performed on the data

-   This generated a set of outputs which are then transferred to blob storage on the NHS England Azure tenant. From there the data are uploaded to the dashboard database and made available

-   Data is analysed to provide outputs for sitreps, EPicell, local authorities, DHSC and others.

-   Data is released at 4 pm daily in a single deployment.

-   Daily deaths (28 days)

    -   The SGSS team send case data to NHS Digital batch tracing service for over night processing - this adds the fact of death. Tracing is done in batches of 250k records

    -   The traced files are shared with Epicell first thing in the morning who then link additional data to generate a line list of deaths which is sent to the Foundry system - usually by 1pm

-   SGSS

    -   The dashboard takes several daily SGSS feeds for cases, positivity and tests during the course of the day.

    -   SGSS is updated by overnight feeds from labs
